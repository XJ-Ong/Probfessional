    <h2>Probability with Slot Machines</h2>
    <p>Slot machines provide an excellent example of independent probability events, where each spin is completely independent of previous spins. This fundamental concept is often misunderstood by players who believe in "hot streaks" or "due wins." Understanding that each spin has the same probability regardless of what happened before is crucial for recognizing how probability truly works.</p>
    <p>Probability in slot machines helps us understand independent events and the multiplication rule of probability. When calculating the probability of multiple independent events occurring together, we multiply their individual probabilities. This explains why getting three specific symbols in a row is so rare - each symbol must appear independently, and the combined probability is the product of each individual probability. This principle applies to many real-world situations beyond gambling.</p>

    <h3>Independent Events</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Each spin is independent - past results do not affect future outcomes</li>
        <li>If P(cherry) = 1/10, P(cherry) on next spin is still <strong>1/10</strong>, regardless of previous spins</li>
        <li>The machine has no memory - "hot streaks" and "due wins" are misconceptions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Multiple Spins</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Three cherries in a row:</strong> If P(cherry) = 1/10 per spin, P(three cherries) = (1/10)³ = <strong>1/1000</strong></li>
        <li><strong>NOT getting cherry in one spin:</strong> P(no cherry) = 1 - 1/10 = <strong>9/10</strong></li>
        <li><strong>At least one jackpot in 3 tries:</strong> P(at least one) = 1 - P(none) = 1 - (249/250)³ ≈ <strong>0.012</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Probability Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multiplication Rule:</strong> For independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)</li>
        <li><strong>Complement Rule:</strong> P(not A) = 1 - P(A)</li>
        <li>Understanding these rules helps calculate complex probabilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Slot machines are games of chance - each outcome is random and independent!</p>
