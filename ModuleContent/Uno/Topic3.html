    <h2>Probability of Drawing Action and Wild Cards</h2>
    <p>UNO''s special cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild) have different probabilities that affect gameplay strategy. Understanding these probabilities helps make better decisions.</p>

    <h3>Action Card Probabilities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Skip Cards:</strong> 8 total (2 per color) = P(skip) = 8/108 = 2/27 ≈ 7.41%</li>
        <li><strong>Reverse Cards:</strong> 8 total (2 per color) = P(reverse) = 8/108 = 2/27 ≈ 7.41%</li>
        <li><strong>Draw Two:</strong> 8 total (2 per color) = P(draw two) = 8/108 = 2/27 ≈ 7.41%</li>
        <li><strong>Wild Cards:</strong> 8 total (4 Wild, 4 Wild Draw Four) = P(wild) = 8/108 = 2/27 ≈ 7.41%</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Combined Probabilities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>P(any action card) = 24/108 = 2/9 ≈ 22.22%</li>
        <li>P(action or wild) = (24 + 8)/108 = 32/108 ≈ 29.63%</li>
        <li>P(number card) = 76/108 ≈ 70.37%</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Game Progression Effects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As cards are played, probabilities of remaining cards increase</li>
        <li>If many action cards are played, remaining deck has more number cards</li>
        <li>Strategic card counting improves probability estimates</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Track which special cards have been played to better predict remaining deck composition!</p>
