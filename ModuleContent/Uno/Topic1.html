    <h2>Probability in UNO</h2>
    <p>UNO uses a deck of 108 cards with specific color and card distributions, creating an engaging way to learn probability through strategic card gameplay. The probability of drawing specific cards changes as the game progresses because cards are not replaced after being drawn. This dynamic nature of probability makes UNO an excellent teaching tool for understanding conditional probability and sampling without replacement.</p>
    <p>Understanding probability in UNO helps players make better strategic decisions. For example, knowing the probability that an opponent has a card of a certain color can influence whether you should change colors or play a wild card. As cards are drawn and discarded throughout the game, the probability calculations become more accurate, allowing skilled players to anticipate likely outcomes and plan their moves accordingly. This demonstrates how probability knowledge can be applied practically in games and decision-making.</p>

    <h3>Card Distribution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Each color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow):</strong> 25 cards per color</li>
        <li><strong>Number cards:</strong> 76 cards (0-9 for each color, with duplicates for 1-9)</li>
        <li><strong>Action cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two):</strong> 24 cards total</li>
        <li><strong>Wild cards:</strong> 8 cards (4 Wild, 4 Wild Draw Four)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Basic Probabilities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drawing a red card:</strong> P(red) = 25/108 ≈ <strong>0.231</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Drawing a Wild card:</strong> P(wild) = 8/108 = <strong>2/27</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Drawing a Skip card:</strong> P(skip) = 8/108 = <strong>2/27</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Top card is not a number:</strong> P(action/wild) = 32/108 ≈ <strong>0.296</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Strategic Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Probability changes as cards are drawn (without replacement)</li>
        <li>Knowing remaining cards helps predict opponent''s hand</li>
        <li>Probability of matching increases if you have cards of the current color</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> UNO uses sampling without replacement, so probabilities update after each draw!</p>
