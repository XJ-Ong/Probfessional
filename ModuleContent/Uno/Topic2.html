    <h2>Color Matching Probabilities in UNO</h2>
    <p>UNO''s color-matching mechanic introduces conditional probability concepts. The probability of matching depends on what card is currently in play and what cards remain in the deck.</p>

    <h3>Color Matching Basics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>P(matching red if red is in play) depends on remaining red cards</li>
        <li>If 20 red cards remain from 90 total, P(red) = 20/90 ≈ 22.2%</li>
        <li>P(matching current color) changes as game progresses</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Strategic Probability</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Playing a color change affects opponent''s matching probability</li>
        <li>If opponent has 7 cards, P(they can play) ≈ 1/4 if colors are balanced</li>
        <li>Wild cards can change probability landscape instantly</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conditional Probability</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>P(drawing red | red is current color) depends on deck state</li>
        <li>P(opponent can play | they have N cards) requires deck analysis</li>
        <li>Probability updates with each card played</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Track played cards to improve probability estimates!</p>
