    <h2>Understanding Dice Probability</h2>
    <p>Dice are one of the simplest tools for learning probability. A standard die has 6 faces, numbered 1 through 6, making it perfect for understanding basic probability concepts. When you roll a die, each face has an equal chance of landing face up, which means each number from 1 to 6 has a probability of 1/6 or approximately 16.67%.</p>
    <p>Probability is fundamentally about understanding the likelihood of different outcomes. With dice, we can explore simple events like rolling a specific number, as well as more complex scenarios involving multiple dice. The beauty of dice probability lies in its simplicity - the outcomes are clear, the possibilities are finite, and the calculations are straightforward.</p>

    <h3>Basic Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single Die:</strong> Probability of rolling any specific number (1-6) is <strong>1/6</strong> or approximately 16.67%</li>
        <li><strong>Even Numbers:</strong> Probability of rolling 2, 4, or 6 is <strong>3/6 = 1/2</strong> (50%)</li>
        <li><strong>Two Dice:</strong> When rolling two dice, outcomes are independent. Total possible outcomes = 6 × 6 = 36</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Common Scenarios</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sum of 7:</strong> The most likely sum with two dice (6 ways: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1) = <strong>6/36 = 1/6</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Doubles:</strong> Probability of rolling the same number on both dice = <strong>6/36 = 1/6</strong></li>
        <li><strong>At least one 6:</strong> When rolling two dice, P(at least one 6) = 1 - P(no sixes) = 1 - (5/6)² = <strong>11/36</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Key Formula:</strong> P(Event) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total possible outcomes</p>
