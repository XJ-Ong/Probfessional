    <h2>Probability with Mahjong Tiles</h2>
    <p>Mahjong uses a set of 144 tiles divided into different categories, creating a rich environment for exploring probability. Unlike dice where outcomes are independent, Mahjong demonstrates sampling without replacement - each tile drawn changes the probability of drawing subsequent tiles. This makes probability calculations in Mahjong more dynamic and interesting.</p>
    <p>Understanding probability in Mahjong is crucial for strategic gameplay. Knowing the likelihood of drawing specific tiles helps players make informed decisions about which tiles to keep and which to discard. Since tiles are not replaced after drawing, the probabilities constantly shift throughout the game, requiring players to recalculate odds as the game progresses.</p>

    <h3>Tile Distribution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bamboo tiles:</strong> 36 tiles (1/3 of deck)</li>
        <li><strong>Character tiles:</strong> 36 tiles (1/3 of deck)</li>
        <li><strong>Dot tiles:</strong> 36 tiles (1/3 of deck)</li>
        <li><strong>Dragon tiles:</strong> 12 tiles (1/12 of deck)</li>
        <li><strong>Wind tiles:</strong> 16 tiles (1/9 of deck)</li>
        <li><strong>Flower tiles:</strong> 8 tiles (1/18 of deck)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Probability Calculations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drawing a specific suit:</strong> P(bamboo) = 36/144 = <strong>1/4</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Drawing a dragon:</strong> P(dragon) = 12/144 = <strong>1/12</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Not drawing a flower:</strong> P(no flower) = 136/144 = <strong>17/18</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Two consecutive draws (without replacement):</strong> Outcomes depend on first draw, reducing total available tiles</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> In Mahjong, probability changes as tiles are drawn because tiles are not replaced (sampling without replacement).</p>
