    <h3>Common Hand Probabilities</h3>
    <ul
        <li><strong>Pair (in 5 cards):</strong> Approximately 42.26%</li>
        <li><strong>Two Pair:</strong> Approximately 4.75%</li>
        <li><strong>Three of a Kind:</strong> Approximately 2.11%</li>
        <li><strong>Straight:</strong> Approximately 0.39% (1 in 254)</li>
        <li><strong>Flush:</strong> Approximately 0.20% (1 in 508)</li>
        <li><strong>Full House:</strong> Approximately 0.14% (1 in 693)</li>
        <li><strong>Four of a Kind:</strong> Approximately 0.024%</li>
        <li><strong>Straight Flush:</strong> Approximately 0.0014%</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Probability Calculations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>P(pair in first two cards) = 3/51 = 1/17 ≈ 5.88%</li>
        <li>P(flush requires 5 cards of same suit) = (13/52) × (12/51) × (11/50) × (10/49) × (9/48) × 4 ≈ 0.198%</li>
        <li>Calculations become complex with multiple cards!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Strategic Application</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding hand probabilities helps assess betting value</li>
        <li>Rare hands (straight, flush) have high value</li>
        <li>Common hands (pairs) are valuable but less rare</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> These probabilities assume random, fair dealing!</p>
