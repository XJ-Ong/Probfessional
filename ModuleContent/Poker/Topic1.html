    <h2>Probability in Poker</h2>
    <p>Poker uses a standard 52-card deck, offering a perfect platform for exploring probability through card games. Understanding probability in poker is essential for making informed betting decisions and reading the game effectively. Each card dealt changes the probability landscape, as cards are drawn without replacement, making the calculations more complex than simple independent events.</p>
    <p>Probability in poker involves calculating the odds of various hands, understanding how the number of cards already dealt affects your chances, and recognizing when the odds are in your favor. Professional poker players rely heavily on probability calculations to determine whether to bet, call, raise, or fold. The key to success lies in combining probability knowledge with psychological insight and strategic thinking.</p>

    <h3>Card Probabilities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drawing an Ace:</strong> 4 Aces out of 52 cards = <strong>4/52 = 1/13</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Red card:</strong> 26 red cards (hearts + diamonds) out of 52 = <strong>26/52 = 1/2</strong> (50%)</li>
        <li><strong>Specific suit (e.g., hearts):</strong> 13 hearts out of 52 = <strong>13/52 = 1/4</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hand Probabilities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pair in two cards:</strong> First card can be anything, second must match = <strong>3/51 = 1/17</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Flush (5 cards, same suit):</strong> Approximately <strong>1/508</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Full house:</strong> Approximately <strong>1/693</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Straight:</strong> Approximately <strong>1/254</strong></li>
    </ul>
